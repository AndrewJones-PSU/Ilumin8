Ilumin8 (pre-release)
=====================

Ilumin8
Version: Development (unreleased)

Ilumin8 is a program for the Arduino Due that acts as a controller for LED strips using NeoPixel/WS281X LED drivers. Our goal with this program is to provide a controller that is easy to use for the end user, yet efficient enough to run elaborate and complex lighting effects, such as syncing lighting effects to music played from a computer. 

Please note that Ilumin8 is currently still in early development, and some parts of the program may be broken and not work as intended, or are currently unimplemented.
